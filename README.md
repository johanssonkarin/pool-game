# Pool Game

A four-ball pool game for two players. Just like regular pool, the goal is to pocket all the balls of the right color. The first player
to achieve this wins! If one player accidently pockets the cue ball (white), the other player will be able to place it anywhere on the table.
If a ball is pocketed, that player will continue playing. If it happens to be one of the the opponent's
balls the player still gets to continue, but the opponent gains the point.
